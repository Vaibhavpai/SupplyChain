# Supply Chain Inventory Rebalancer — OpenM RL Environment

An advanced reinforcement learning environment for optimizing multi-warehouse inventory management with **process supervision rewards**. Designed for the OpenM hackathon.

## Overview

This environment simulates a supply chain with three warehouses (east, central, west) managing five SKUs across 30-45 day horizons. Agents learn to minimize stockouts and costs through dynamic inventory transfers.

### Key Features

✅ **Process Supervision**: Per-step intermediate rewards for multiple decision-quality signals  
✅ **Three Difficulty Levels**: Progressive tasks from simple restocking to complex supply shocks  
✅ **OpenM Compatible**: Structured state/action/observation/reward per OpenM standards  
✅ **Production Ready**: Gradio UI + FastAPI REST API + Docker deployment  
✅ **Deterministic & Reproducible**: Seeded random generation for consistent evaluation  

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd OpenEnv-master
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Demo

```bash
# Test with rule-based agents (no GPU)
python run_episode_demo.py --task 2 --agent greedy

# Launch interactive Gradio web UI
python inference.py
# Visit http://localhost:7860
```

### Train RL Model

```bash
# First, install PyTorch from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Then train
python train.py --task 2 --epochs 10 --batch_size 8
```

## Environment Structure

### Components (Per OpenM Spec)

#### **Action** 
```python
{
  "transfers": [
    {"source_node": "central", 
     "destination_node": "west",
     "sku": "SKU_A", 
     "quantity": 50}
  ],
  "advance_time": true
}
```
- Validated against inventory levels and routing constraints
- Returns penalties for invalid actions (-50 reward)

#### **Observation**
```python
{
  "current_day": 5,
  "warehouses": [
    {
      "warehouse_id": "east",
      "current_inventory": {"SKU_A": 120, ...},
      "incoming_shipments": [
        {"source_node": "central", "sku": "SKU_A", 
         "quantity": 50, "arrives_on_day": 8}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "shipping_rates": {...},
  "transit_times": {...},
  "demand_forecast": [...],
  "active_alerts": [...]
}
```
- Includes 3-day forward-looking demand forecast
- Real-time in-transit shipment tracking
- Optional operational alerts (supplier disruptions)

#### **State** (Internal)
- Current inventory levels per warehouse per SKU
- In-transit shipments with arrival dates
- Accumulated costs (holding, shipping, unfulfilled)
- Demand realization history
- Stochastic demand pattern

#### **Reward** (Process Supervision Enhanced)

Multi-component reward signal designed for intermediate reinforcement learning:

```python
{
  # Base fulfillment metrics
  "fulfilled_demand_reward": 2.0,          # +2.0 per unit fulfilled
  "stockout_penalty": -5.0,                # -5.0 per unit shortfall
  
  # Cost penalties
  "holding_cost_penalty": -1.0,            # -$ per unit·day·warehouse
  "shipping_cost_penalty": -1.5,           # -$ per unit·route
  
  # Process supervision (intermediate signals)
  "inventory_balance_reward": 0.5,         # transfers toward balanced state
  "demand_forecast_accuracy_reward": 0.8,  # alignment with predicted demand
  "proactive_restocking_bonus": 2.0,       # prevents forecasted stockouts
  "safety_margin_bonus": 0.5,              # maintains 5-day buffer stock
  "temporal_incentive_bonus": 0.3,         # early intervention preference
  
  # Safety constraints
  "invalid_action_penalty": 0.0,           # -50.0 if violated constraints
  "safety_violation_penalty": 0.0,         # -10.0 for risky decisions
  
  "total": 5.3
}
```

**Detailed metrics** (for model transparency):
- `inventory_balance_score`: [-1.0, +1.0] whether transfers reduce imbalance
- `demand_forecast_alignment`: [0.0, 1.0] how well transfers match forecast
- `stockout_prevention_score`: [0.0, 1.0] likelihood of preventing future shortfalls
- `safety_margin`: ratio of inventory to (avg_daily_demand × 3-day horizon)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Simple Restock (Easy)
- **Duration**: Auto (1-5 steps)
- **Goal**: Transfer ≥50 units of SKU_A from Central to West
- **Scoring**: Binary (0.0 or 1.0)
- **Use Case**: Validation and debugging

### Task 2: Cost-Optimized Rebalancing (Medium)
- **Duration**: 30 days
- **Initial State**: Imbalanced inventory across warehouses
- **Disruption**: Supplier 1 offline from day 1-7
- **Goal**: Minimize (holding costs + stockouts)
- **Scoring**: 
  - Start: 1.0
  - -0.025 per stockout event
  - -0.02 per $100 above baseline ($1000)
  - Result: [0.0, 1.0]

### Task 3: Supply Shock (Hard)
- **Duration**: 45 days
- **Balanced Start**: All warehouses equally stocked
- **Shock**: Day 3 supplier goes offline, cascading shortages
- **Goal**: Maximize fulfillment rate and minimize wasteful transfers
- **Scoring**: (total_fulfilled / total_demanded) - cost_penalty
  - Cost penalty applied to discourage wasteful transfers
  - Central warehouse has surplus inventory to redistribute
  - Result: [0.0, 1.0]

## Reward Engineering Highlights

### Why Process Supervision?

Traditional RL environments reward only final outcomes. This environment provides **per-step intermediate signals** to guide learning:

1. **Balance Signal** (+0.5 if reducing inventory gaps)
   - Helps agent learn equilibrium strategies early

2. **Forecast Alignment** (+1.0 per alignment score)
   - Model learns to interpret demand patterns

3. **Prevention Bonus** (+2.0 for avoiding future stockouts)
   - Encourages proactive decision-making

4. **Safety Margin** (+0.5 for maintaining buffer stock)
   - Balances cost minimization with risk management

5. **Temporal Incentive** (bonus higher on earlier days)
   - Prefers early intervention to last-minute fixes

This **multi-signal design** accelerates convergence and produces more robust policies.

## API Reference

### Python

```python
from env_wrapper import SupplyChainTextEnv

# Create environment
env = SupplyChainTextEnv(task_id=2, seed=42)

# Reset and get initial observation
obs_text = env.reset()
print(obs_text)

# Execute action
action_json = '{"transfers": [], "advance_time": true}'
obs_text, reward, done, info = env.step(action_json)

print(f"Reward: {reward}")
print(f"Breakdown: {info['reward_breakdown']}")
print(f"Done: {done}")

# Grade episode
grade = env.grade()
print(f"Score: {grade['score']}")
```

### REST API

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#rest-api-endpoints) for full endpoint documentation.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Rule-based Agents
| Agent   | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Random  | ✗ (4%) | ✗ (0%) | ✗ (0%) |
| Greedy  | ✓ (95%) | ~ (45%) | ✗ (5%) |

### Expected LLM Performance
- **Task 1**: >95% (easy pattern recognition)
- **Task 2**: 50-70% (moderate planning + cost optimization)
- **Task 3**: 20-40% (long-horizon reasoning + disruption handling)

## Environment Determinism

All stochasticity is seeded for reproducibility:

```python
env1 = SupplyChainTextEnv(task_id=2, seed=42)
env2 = SupplyChainTextEnv(task_id=2, seed=42)

# Same seed → identical trajectories
env1.reset()
env2.reset()
# demand patterns, random variations will be identical
```

## Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
python inference.py
# → http://localhost:7860
```

### Hugging Face Spaces
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-space
cp * your-space/
cd your-space && git push
```

For detailed deployment steps, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Development & Contributing

### Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Add Custom Task
Edit `_TASK_CATALOGUE` in `environment.py`:
```python
4: {
    "inventory": {...},
    "demand_pattern": {...},
    "horizon": 60,
    "alerts": [...]
}
```

### Extend Reward Signal
Modify `_compute_reward()` in `environment.py` and add new metrics to `ProcessSupervisionReward` in `models.py`.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Gradio UI not responding**  
A: Check port 7860 is free. Kill existing process: `lsof -i :7860 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill`

**Q: Reward seems stuck at baseline**  
A: Check `info['violations']` for constraint violations. Action validation -50 penalty dominates early rewards.

**Q: Train.py OOM (out of memory)**  
A: Reduce `--batch_size`. Default is 8 for single GPU.
